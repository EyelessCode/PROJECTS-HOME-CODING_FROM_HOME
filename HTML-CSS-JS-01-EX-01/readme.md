Hello, this is my project. I created a page of the tour Ecuador. You can make a tour in Ecuador and see the most beautiful places of this country. You can see the pictures of the places and read the information about them. You can calculate the subtotal, total with obviusly the IVA. You can also see the information of the tour.

This is project was made because an apps web exam, and I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make it. I used the DOM to interact with the user and to make the calculations. I used also the CSS to make the page look nice and to make the responsive design. I used the JavaScript to make the calculations and to interact with the user.

This it's the page:
